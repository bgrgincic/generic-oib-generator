Random generic OIB generator

A javascript driven page for generating a large number of generic OIB numbers.

The Personal identification number (Croatian: Osobni identifikacijski broj or OIB) is a permanent national identification number of every Croatian citizen and legal persons domiciled in the Republic of Croatia. 

OIB consists of 11 digits which contain no personal information, unlike the previous unique identification number scheme. The OIB is constructed from ten randomly chosen digits and one digit control number (international standard ISO 7064, module 11.10). For the purposes of international data exchange, the letters HR are added preceding the eleven digits.
